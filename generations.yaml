    description: "The Lexus NX 350h represents the hybrid variant of the second-generation Lexus NX compact luxury crossover, replacing the previous NX 300h model with significant improvements in power, efficiency, and technology. Powered by a fourth-generation hybrid system combining a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine with electric motors for a total system output of 239 horsepower (a 45 horsepower increase over its predecessor), paired with an electronically controlled continuously variable transmission (ECVT). This powertrain delivers an EPA-estimated 39 mpg combined for front-wheel drive models and 38 mpg for all-wheel drive variants, making it one of the most fuel-efficient vehicles in its class while offering significantly improved acceleration. Standard all-wheel drive features a dedicated rear electric motor providing seamless power distribution between front and rear wheels. The exterior design evolved from the first-generation NX with a more sophisticated interpretation of the spindle grille, sleeker headlights, and a connected taillight design. The interior represents a major advancement with the new Lexus Interface multimedia system featuring a standard 9.8-inch or available 14-inch touchscreen display with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, cloud-based navigation, and native voice assistant capabilities. This system replaces the previous Remote Touch interface with more intuitive controls, including physical buttons for frequently used functions. Driver assistance technology expanded with Lexus Safety System+ 3.0 including enhanced pre-collision system with motorcycle detection, intersection support, and emergency steering assist. Additional features include a digital key system allowing smartphone access, wireless smartphone charging, and a digital rearview mirror. As the first hybrid model to adopt the new numerical naming convention (previous hybrid models used 'h' designations like 300h), the NX 350h positions itself as a premium hybrid crossover offering both enhanced performance and exceptional efficiency, appealing to environmentally conscious luxury buyers looking for a practical yet refined vehicle."
